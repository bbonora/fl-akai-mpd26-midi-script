## Installation

1. Download the [zip](https://github.com/bbonora/fl-akai-mpd26-midi-script/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) file and extract the files to here `C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\akai-mpd26`

1. In the FL Studio MIDI settings, select Akai MPD26 (user) from the controller type dropdown.

## MPD26 Setup

All of the buttons, pads, and faders have been mapped to functionality within Fl Studio. The first two knobs have been mapped but the remaining ones are free at the moment. However this could change in the future.
### Buttons

The buttons are mapped to the transport controls but when certain windows or plugins are focused some of the functionality changes. Below I've outlined the functionality for each button as well as the expected hardware settings.

#### Play
**Hardware Settings:** 

#### Stop

#### Record
#### Next

#### Previous

### Faders

The faders are mapped to the mixer faders


### Knobs
